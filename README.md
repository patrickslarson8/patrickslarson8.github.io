Website files for personal resume website

This website was purposely created with vanilla HTML, Javascript, and CSS to further my understanding of what's happening "under the hood" in tools like Bootstrap. It has a responsive design and works on mobile and desktop displays. Not only does the page re-size to fill the screen, the layout of the sections changes to transition from mouse to touchscreen navigation.

The sidebar on the right is built using only javascript and is designed to disappear on mobile pages, as the "tracking" function does not work properly on touchscreen devices. The "bubble" for my various projects are all responsive and re-order themselves to best fill large and small displays.
